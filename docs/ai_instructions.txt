Absolutely. Below is a **clean, authoritative rewrite** of your `.txt` document, **explicitly scoped to the MVP** you defined:

> **MVP = Students + Communications + Calendar + Scheduling**

This version:

* Removes non-MVP noise
* Preserves future-proofing without adding weight
* Is written to guide AI coding tools clearly and consistently
* Can be pasted directly into `docs/ai_instructions.txt`

# Checkmate AI Scheduler

## MVP Architecture, Code, and UI Instructions (Authoritative)

This document defines the **single source of truth** for all AI-generated code for the **MVP version** of Checkmate AI Scheduler.

The MVP scope is intentionally limited to:

* Student Management
* Scheduling
* Calendar Visualization
* Automated Communications

All code must follow this document **exactly** unless explicitly stated otherwise.

---

## 1. Tech Stack (Authoritative)

```
Backend: Django (Python)
Frontend: React (TypeScript)
Database (development): SQLite
Database (deployment): PostgreSQL
Automation / glue: Python
```

---

## 2. MVP Architectural Rules (Non-Negotiable)

```
- Business logic lives in Django (Python)
- UI logic lives in React (TypeScript)
- Scheduling logic lives ONLY in the backend
- No database logic in the frontend
- One Django app per business domain
- Frontend structure mirrors backend domains
- Django Admin is the primary internal ERP interface
- Prefer boring, standard patterns over clever abstractions
```

This is an **ERP-style scheduling system**, not a demo or prototype.
Correctness, clarity, and maintainability are more important than speed or novelty.

## 3. MVP High-Level Repository Structure

```text
checkmate-driving/
│
├── backend/
│   ├── manage.py
│   ├── config/
│   │   ├── settings.py
│   │   ├── urls.py
│   │   └── wsgi.py
│   │
│   ├── apps/
│   │   ├── core/             # shared utilities, helpers
│   │   ├── users/            # staff and instructor accounts
│   │   ├── orgs/             # single school (future-safe)
│   │   ├── students/
│   │   ├── appointments/
│   │   ├── scheduling/       # pure scheduling logic
│   │   └── communications/
│   │
│   └── scripts/
│       └── send_reminders.py
│
├── frontend/
│   ├── src/
│   │   ├── api/
│   │   ├── components/
│   │   ├── pages/
│   │   ├── calendar/
│   │   └── types/
│   │
│   └── package.json
│
└── docs/
    └── ai_instructions.txt
```

This structure is **intentionally simple and conventional**.
AI-generated code must not invent new top-level folders or architectural layers.

---

## 4. Backend Apps (MVP Only)

Each backend app represents **one business domain**.

---

### 4.1 `students/` — Student Management

```text
students/
├── models.py
├── serializers.py
├── views.py
├── urls.py
└── admin.py
```

**Responsibilities**

* Student records
* Contact information
* Status (active / completed)
* Association to appointments

---

### 4.2 `appointments/` — Appointment Database

```text
appointments/
├── models.py
├── serializers.py
├── views.py
├── urls.py
└── admin.py
```

**Responsibilities**

* Appointment date & time
* Duration
* Student
* Instructor
* Status (scheduled, completed, canceled)

This app is the **source of truth** for the calendar.

---

### 4.3 `scheduling/` — Scheduling Logic (Pure Python)

```text
scheduling/
├── services.py
└── rules.py
```

**Responsibilities**

* Conflict detection
* Availability checks
* Scheduling validation rules

⚠️ **No models. No views. No UI logic.**
This app contains pure business logic only.

---

### 4.4 `communications/` — Automated Communications

```text
communications/
├── services.py
├── tasks.py
└── templates/
    └── reminder_email.html
```

**Responsibilities**

* Automated reminder emails
* Completion notifications (future)
* Message sending logic
* Message logging (basic)

---

### 4.5 Supporting Apps (MVP-Required)

#### `users/`

* Staff users
* Instructor users
* Authentication

#### `orgs/`

* Single driving school
* Timezone
* Business hours

These apps are simple in MVP but **must exist** to avoid future rewrites.

---

## 5. Frontend Structure (React / TypeScript)

The frontend mirrors backend domains and focuses only on MVP functionality.

---

### 5.1 Shared Types (Critical)

```text
types/
├── student.ts
└── appointment.ts
```

These types **must match backend serializers exactly**.

---

### 5.2 API Layer (Strict Boundary)

```text
api/
├── students.ts
├── appointments.ts
└── scheduling.ts
```

Rules:

* Only network calls live here
* No UI logic
* No scheduling logic

---

### 5.3 Pages (Screens)

```text
pages/
├── StudentsPage.tsx
└── CalendarPage.tsx
```

---

### 5.4 Calendar UI

```text
calendar/
├── CalendarView.tsx
└── CalendarEvent.tsx
```

**Responsibilities**

* Visual representation of appointments
* Day / week views
* Read-only in MVP (no drag-and-drop)

---

### 5.5 Forms & Input Components

```text
components/
├── StudentForm.tsx
├── AppointmentForm.tsx
└── ScheduleForm.tsx
```

**Responsibilities**

* User input
* Client-side validation
* Submitting data to backend APIs

---

## 6. MVP Functional Coverage

| Function            | Backend App      | Frontend Area  |
| ------------------- | ---------------- | -------------- |
| Student Management  | `students`       | StudentsPage   |
| Scheduling          | `scheduling`     | ScheduleForm   |
| Appointment Storage | `appointments`   | CalendarView   |
| Calendar View       | `appointments`   | calendar/      |
| Communications      | `communications` | Backend-driven |

Anything not listed above is **explicitly out of scope for MVP**.

---

## 7. Brand & UI Guidance (Authoritative)

**Product Name:** Checkmate AI Scheduler

**Brand Personality:**
Modern, calm, intelligent, and professional. The interface should feel **quietly powerful**, optimized for clarity and focus in data-heavy scheduling workflows.

---

### Visual Style Rules

* Dark-first UI
* High contrast with subtle gradients
* Rounded corners (8–10px)
* Smooth hover transitions
* Clean grid-based layouts
* No skeuomorphism or decorative textures

---

### Primary Color Palette

#eab308
#6366f1
#22d3ee

---

### UI Rules for AI-Generated Code

```
- Default to dark theme
- Use CSS variables for all colors
- Do not hardcode arbitrary colors
- Prefer subtle gradients over flat fills
- Optimize for tables and calendar views
- Favor clarity over density
```

---

## 8. Final Instruction to AI Coding Tools

> When generating code for this project:
>
> * Follow this document exactly
> * Stay within MVP scope
> * Keep files small and modular
> * Do not introduce non-MVP features
> * Do not invent new architectural layers

---

If you want, next I can:

* Lock the **exact MVP data models**
* Define **scheduling conflict rules**
* Specify **calendar behavior (UX rules)**
* Write a **Cursor / Copilot system prompt** using this doc

Just tell me the next step.
